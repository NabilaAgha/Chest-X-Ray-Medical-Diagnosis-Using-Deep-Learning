# 🏥 Medical Image Classification using Computer Vision

📌 Introduction

Computer Vision (CV) is transforming medical diagnostics, aiding in the detection of diseases across multiple fields:

Dermatology – Identifying skin conditions.
Ophthalmology – Detecting eye disorders.
Histopathology – Analyzing tissue abnormalities.
X-ray Imaging – Diagnosing lung cancer, pneumonia, and more.

🎯 Project Overview

This project focuses on classifying chest X-ray images to detect medical conditions using deep learning.

🔍 Key Steps:

✔️ Data Preprocessing – Prepare images for training, validation, and testing.
✔️ Pre-trained Model Utilization – Implement CNN-based models for accurate predictions.
✔️ ChestX-ray8 Dataset – Work with a large, publicly available dataset.
